    <p>In this clear and concise volume, author David Chandler provides a timely overview of Cambodia, a small but increasingly visible Southeast Asia nation. Hailed by the Journal of Southeast Asian Studies as an original contribution, superior to any other existing work, this acclaimed text has now been completely revised and updated to include material examining the early history of Cambodia, whose famous Angkorean ruins now attract more than one million tourists each year, the death of Pol Pot, and the revolution and final collapse of the Khmer Rouge. With new material covering the challenges facing today's Cambodia, the fourth edition reflects recent research by major scholars as well as Chandler's long immersion in the subject. This comprehensive overview will illuminate—for undergraduate students as well as general readers—the history and contemporary politics of a country long misunderstood.</p>
